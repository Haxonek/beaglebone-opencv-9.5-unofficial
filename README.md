# Repo Notes

This is not an official repo and probably isn't useful to anyone. There reason I have this is because compiling opencv on a beaglebone takes upwards of ten hours, and by uploading this I can pull it down again if I never need to reinstall it without waiting ~ten hours. to install just run the following commands:

```
cd build
sudo make install
```

And that's it. Check the official website for other packages you may need, glhf
